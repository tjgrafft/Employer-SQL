## Objectives
The purpose of this project is to Extract, Load, and Transform two databases I aquired from Kaggle that represent the pizza restaurants and their menus across the United States.

### Methods Used
* Data Modeling
* Data Engineering
* Data Analysis

### Technologies 
* Entity Relationship Diagram
* SQL and SQL Queries
* Visual Studio Code

### Steps to Complete Project
* The first major task was a research project on employees of the Pewlett Hackard corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remained of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
* Created schema in SQL to house the data in various tables
* Created ERD to show relationships between data and set primary keys, foreign keys, etc.
* Wrote SQL Queries to find relevent data and answer my questions
